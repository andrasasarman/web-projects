The subject of the painting is unknown, with it being possible either that she was a real model, or that Vermeer created a more generalised and mysterious woman, perhaps representing a Sibyl or biblical figure.[4] There has been speculation that she is the artist's eldest daughter, Maria, though this has been dismissed as an anachronism by some art historians.",
